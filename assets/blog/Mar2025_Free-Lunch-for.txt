Free Lunch for the Body and Mind
March 2025

How can an activity be so perfect? Is this truly a free lunch? These thoughts occupy my mind as I shower after my longest run since the Mumbai Half in January. It's nearly 10 PM, and I've just returned from a 15K on a new route. When was the last time I explored unfamiliar paths in Jersey City or New York? There aren't many runnable sections in these cities I haven't at least passed through by now.

Today's route began as usual, heading east from Journal Square towards the river, then along the waterfront past Newport until the Hoboken Path station. But instead of turning left and heading back as I typically do, I continued along the river for about 8K more. On my right, the magnificent New York skyline loomed, its reflection shimmering in the Hudson's dancing waves. On my left, for part of the way, stood the imposing stone wall upon which Jersey City rests. As I ran along the flat waterfront road, the wall grew taller and taller, foreshadowing the hill awaiting me on my eventual return. I didn't let thoughts of the impending climb deter me and continued north, past Stevens and a football field, until I was aligned with the Empire State Building on my right, at which point my watch finally instructed me to turn left and begin my return journey.

About 45 minutes in, I took an energy gel I'd brought along — my first time using one during a practice run. With about six weeks remaining until the Brooklyn Half, it was time to start training with gels so my body could adapt to digesting food while moving, avoiding any surprises on race day. The best aspect of this route was its variety. It featured not only the breathtaking, extended waterfront segment alongside the ever-growing stone wall, but also the longest, straightest road I've ever run on, a passage through historic Hoboken streets, and perhaps the most satisfying gradual bridge climb I've experienced — excellent preparation for Brooklyn's notorious rolling hills. The night weather was perfect: warm enough that I didn't need layers or a beanie, yet just breezy enough to prevent overheating — the kind of conditions every runner dreams of.

As I neared home, familiar surroundings emerged: first the Indian restaurants and Asian grocery stores scattered throughout Jersey City, then the two characteristically tall, white Journal Squared apartment buildings rising sharply from the otherwise poorly lit backdrop. Finally, I converged with the last section of my usual route, signaling the end of my run. Once I stopped, I ended the workout on my watch and picked up a protein drink and pasta sauce (essential for my dinner) from the local grocery store. I've been trying to increase my daily protein intake over recent weeks and have realized that without protein supplements, reaching my daily target isn't easy, being vegetarian and all.

Now, as I exit the shower and sit down to write, I'm filled with post-run euphoria. My thoughts are crystal clear and flow effortlessly after a long, meditative run, so I've decided that henceforth, I'll complete my journal entry immediately after showering. By the way, why do adults call it a journal while children call it a diary? I digress. This euphoric feeling isn't rare. The runner's high has become a common occurrence for me, especially during these past weeks of intense race training. I've noticed the feeling is most prominent when I'm relatively well-rested from my previous run. Since my watch coach rarely gives me rest days, I'm most recovered when I ran the previous morning and the present evening, allowing the whole of yesterday and most of today for recovery.

There are early signals during my run that indicate I'll inevitably feel this way afterward. My well-rested legs feel stronger than usual, each stride effortless; a springiness akin to what paralympic runners might experience on their "blades." Every ground contact propels me forward with remarkable efficiency; I feel almost gazelle-like. My thoughts flow freely, and not once do I contemplate pain or suffering. Yet after the run, it all feels like either a dream or a distant, happy memory. It's almost miraculous how I cannot, for the life of me, recollect even one coherent thought from my run. I remember listening to a podcast and some topics discussed, but I cannot recall any of my own conscious thoughts.

A long, easy-paced run is indistinguishable from meditation. It requires just enough effort that I'm unable to focus on distracting thoughts, yet demands little enough that pain doesn't intrude. Running, I realize, is the first activity that reliably delivers extreme joy, consistently, whenever I desire it, regardless of whether I'm having a wonderful day or a terrible one. Add to this the fact that I can run whenever and wherever I want, needing only a pair of shoes. Tell me, is this not the definition of a free lunch? I recognize that in this description, I'm portraying running as almost psychedelic — reliably, consistently, and regularly transporting me to an altered state of consciousness inaccessible to my normal self. I must sound like a running evangelist, similar to how Joe Rogan describes his experiences with DMT and cold plunging. But I see it clearly now. I cannot help but describe it as a life-altering drug because that's precisely what it is, without any side effects. Not just a free lunch, but a complimentary feast for both body and mind.
