We ask here whether such networks can provide a useful model for how people recognize objects. Human recognition time varies, from 0.1 to 10 s, depending on the stimulus and task. Slowness of recognition is a key feature in some public health issues, such as dyslexia, so it is crucial to create a model of human speed-accuracy trade-offs. This is an essential aspect of any useful computational model of human cognitive behavior. We present a benchmark dataset for human speed-accuracy trade-off in recognizing a CIFAR-10 image~\\cite{Krizhevsky09learningmultiple} from a set of provided class labels. Within a series of trials, a beep sounds at a fixed delay after the target (the desired reaction time), and the response counts only if it occurs near that time. We observe that accuracy grows with reaction time and examine several dynamic neural networks that exhibit a speed-accuracy trade-off as humans do. After limiting the network resources and adding image perturbations (grayscale conversion, noise, blur) to bring the two observers (human and network) into the same accuracy range, humans and networks show very similar dependence on duration or floating point operations (FLOPS). We conclude that dynamic neural networks are a promising model of human reaction time in recognition tasks. Understanding how the brain allocates appropriate resources under time pressure would be a milestone in neuroscience and a first step toward understanding conditions like dyslexia. Our dataset and code are publicly available.","tags":["visual object recognition","computer vision","psychophysics","psychology"],"title":"Using Dynamic Neural Networks to Model the Speed-Accuracy Trade-Off in People","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ajay Subramanian","Sharad Chitlangia","Veeky Baths"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1612137600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1612137600,"objectID":"21792361bf830b517ba01832d0fdfc54","permalink":"https://ajaysub110.github.io/publication/subramanian2021reinforcement/","publishdate":"2021-02-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/subramanian2021reinforcement/","section":"publication","summary":"Reinforcement learning methods have recently been very successful at performing complex sequential tasks like playing Atari games, Go and Poker. These algorithms have outperformed humans in several tasks by learning from scratch, using only scalar rewards obtained through interaction with their environment. While there certainly has been considerable independent innovation in the area to produce such results, many core ideas in reinforcement learning are inspired by phenomena of animal learning, psychology and neuroscience. In this paper, we comprehensively review a number of findings in neuroscience and psychology that provide evidence for the plausibility of reinforcement learning being a promising model for phenomena in human learning, decision making and behavior. We do so by a) exploring neuroscientific evidence for various classes of RL algorithms along with their building blocks, and b) mapping specific RL ideas to findings in neuroscience and psychology. Finally, we discuss the implications of these findings and their role in advancing research in both AI and brain science.","tags":["Reinforcement Learning","Neuroscience","Psychology"],"title":"Reinforcement Learning and its Connections with Neuroscience and Psychology","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ajay Subramanian","吳恩達"],"categories":["Demo","教程"],"content":"Overview  The Wowchemy website builder for Hugo, along with its starter templates, is designed for professional creators, educators, and teams/organizations - although it can be used to create any kind of site The template can be modified and customised to suit your needs.

Extensive study is being done to gauge the involvement of various regions of the brain in the processing of external stimuli. A study by Ostarek et al. has produced experimental evidence of the involvement of low-level visual representations in spoken word processing, using Continuous Flash Suppression (CFS). For example, hearing the word ‘car’ induces a visual representation of a car in extrastriate areas of the visual cortex that seems to have a spatial resolution of some kind. Though the structure of these areas of the brain has been extensively studied, research hasn’t really delved into the functional aspects. In this work, we aim to take this a step further by experimenting with generative models such as Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) (Kingma et al 2013) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) (Goodfellow et al. 2014) to generate images purely from the EEG signals induced by listening to spoken words of objects.","tags":["Deep Learning","Cognitive Neuroscience"],"title":"Word2Brain2Image: Visual Reconstruction from Spoken Word Representations","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Create slides in Markdown with Wowchemy Wowchemy | Documentation\n Features  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides   Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E   Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot; if porridge == \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot;: print(\u0026quot;Eating...\u0026quot;)   Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = ;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\n Fragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}}  Press Space to play!\nOne  Two  Three \n A fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears   Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}}  Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view    Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links    night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links   Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026quot;/media/boards.jpg\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026quot;#0000FF\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026quot;my-style\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}   Custom CSS Example Let\u0026rsquo;s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; }   Questions?
