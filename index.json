Various time-constrained tasks demand a wide range of accuracy and latency. Previous work (Spoerer’20) has modeled only modest speed-accuracy tradeoffs (SATs) with a min-to-max range of merely 6% accuracy and 200 ms reaction time, a tiny fraction of the human range. Here, we collect and present a public human benchmark where we use image perturbations to adjust task difficulty and increase the accuracy range to more than 50%. Furthermore, we show that dynamic neural networks are a promising model of the SAT and capture the behavior without needing recurrence. 142 online participants categorized CIFAR-10 images with controlled reaction time. Reaction time (RT) was defined as the elapsed time between stimulus presentation and a keypress response. We ran 5 blocks of 300 trials, each with a different reaction time from 200-1000 ms and repeated the experiment with 4 different viewing conditions, color, grayscale, noise, and blur. Three networks, MSDNet (Huang’17), SCAN (Zhang’19), and ConvRNN (Spoerer’20) were trained on CIFAR-10 image classification. Using FLOPs as an analogue for human reaction time, we tested these networks by forcing them to “respond” using different amounts of computation, across all viewing conditions. We compared the three networks and humans using two metrics, accuracy range (difference between maximum and minimum accuracy when reaction time is varied) and correlation between speed-accuracy trade-off curves. MSDNet gives a better account than previous attempts without needing recurrence. When trained with noise, it shows high correlation (0.93) with human SAT. However, humans are much more flexible, with a large 51% accuracy range while the best network, MSDNet trained with noise, shows only 19%. Thus, our benchmark presents a challenging goal for future work that aims to model SAT.","tags":[],"title":"Benchmarking dynamic neural-network models of the human speed-accuracy tradeoff","type":"publication"},{"authors":["James Paul Turner","James C Knight","Ajay Subramanian","Thomas Nowotny"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1646006400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1646006400,"objectID":"1f74885e8a18cfbcfdec02dc1c7ff9d1","permalink":"https://ajaysub110.github.io/publication/turner2022mlgenn/","publishdate":"2022-02-28T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/turner2022mlgenn/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"mlGeNN: Accelerating SNN inference using GPU-Enabled Neural Networks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ajay Subramanian","Omkar Kumbhar","Elena Sizikova","Najib Majaj","Denis G.

The reaction time depends on the stimulus and task, and people can trade off speed for accuracy. That tradeoff is a crucial human skill. Neural networks exhibit high accuracy in object recognition, but most current models cannot dynamically adapt to respond with less computation, which is a problem in time-sensitive applications like driving. Towards the goal of using networks to model how people recognize objects, we here present a benchmark dataset (with model fits) of the human speed-accuracy tradeoff (SAT) in recognizing CIFAR-10 and STL-10 images. In each trial, a beep, indicating the desired reaction time, sounds at a fixed delay after the target onset, and the observer's response counts only if it occurs near the time of the beep. With practice, observers quickly learn to respond at the time of the beep. In a series of blocks, we test many beep latencies, i.e., reaction times. We observe that human accuracy increases with reaction time, and we compare its characteristics with the behavior of several dynamic neural networks that can trade off speed and accuracy. After limiting the network resources and adding image perturbations (grayscale conversion, noise, blur) to bring the two observers (human and network) into the same accuracy range, we show that humans and networks exhibit very similar tradeoffs. We conclude that dynamic neural networks are a promising model of human reaction time in recognition tasks. Our dataset and code are publicly available.","tags":["visual object recognition","computer vision","psychophysics","psychology"],"title":"SATBench: A Benchmark of the Human Speed-Accuracy Tradeoff in Recognizing Objects","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ajay Subramanian","Sharad Chitlangia","Veeky Baths"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1612137600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1612137600,"objectID":"21792361bf830b517ba01832d0fdfc54","permalink":"https://ajaysub110.github.io/publication/subramanian2021reinforcement/","publishdate":"2021-10-22T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/subramanian2021reinforcement/","section":"publication","summary":"Reinforcement learning methods have recently been very successful at performing complex sequential tasks like playing Atari games, Go and Poker. These algorithms have outperformed humans in several tasks by learning from scratch, using only scalar rewards obtained through interaction with their environment. While there certainly has been considerable independent innovation to produce such results, many core ideas in reinforcement learning are inspired by phenomena in animal learning, psychology and neuroscience. In this paper, we comprehensively review a large number of findings in both neuroscience and psychology that evidence reinforcement learning as a promising candidate for modeling learning and decision making in the brain. In doing so, we construct a mapping between various classes of modern RL algorithms and specific findings in both neurophysiological and behavioral literature. We then discuss the implications of this observed relationship between RL, neuroscience and psychology and its role in advancing research in both AI and brain science.","tags":["Reinforcement learning","Neuroscience","Psychology"],"title":"Reinforcement learning and its connections with neuroscience and psychology","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ajay Subramanian","吳恩達"],"categories":["Demo","教程"],"content":"Overview  The Wowchemy website builder for Hugo, along with its starter templates, is designed for professional creators, educators, and teams/organizations - although it can be used to create any kind of site The template can be modified and customised to suit your needs.

Extensive study is being done to gauge the involvement of various regions of the brain in the processing of external stimuli. A study by Ostarek et al. has produced experimental evidence of the involvement of low-level visual representations in spoken word processing, using Continuous Flash Suppression (CFS). For example, hearing the word ‘car’ induces a visual representation of a car in extrastriate areas of the visual cortex that seems to have a spatial resolution of some kind. Though the structure of these areas of the brain has been extensively studied, research hasn’t really delved into the functional aspects. In this work, we aim to take this a step further by experimenting with generative models such as Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) (Kingma et al 2013) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) (Goodfellow et al. 2014) to generate images purely from the EEG signals induced by listening to spoken words of objects.","tags":["Deep Learning","Cognitive Neuroscience"],"title":"Word2Brain2Image: Visual Reconstruction from Spoken Word Representations","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Create slides in Markdown with Wowchemy Wowchemy | Documentation\n Features  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides   Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E   Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot; if porridge == \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot;: print(\u0026quot;Eating...\u0026quot;)   Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = ;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\n Fragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}}  Press Space to play!\nOne  Two  Three \n A fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears   Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}}  Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view    Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links    night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links   Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026quot;/media/boards.jpg\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026quot;#0000FF\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026quot;my-style\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}   Custom CSS Example Let\u0026rsquo;s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; }   Questions?
